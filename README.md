# Aeroponic Plant Station
A concept application of a domestic aeroponics plant station

## The Idea
Domestic hydropnic stations have existed for a number of years, allowing occupants of flats to enjoy the pleasures of growing produce at home. However, there is another technology that could prove far easier and cheaper to use. Aeroponics is currently only used by Nasa on the ISS and there are no popular domestic systems available. A friend of mine is hoping to change that I have agreed to help him design and build an application to interact with such a system.

What follows will be a timeline of our progress and hopefully in the end a fully functional native application!

### 07/01/19

I have designed the first concept for the native app. A simple friendly interface that allows the user to stay up to date with various metrics concerning their aeroponics system.
